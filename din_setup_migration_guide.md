- Invoice will be auto paid from the SetUP system balance if there are enough credits in the account, or the wallet will ask YES/NO to pay with SIN coins.

("Invoice paid from credit balance" message will appear if there are enough credits)

  

- SetUP will go through the setup process in the background.  
 Do not shut down the wallet or send any transactions until the setup is "Finished."
