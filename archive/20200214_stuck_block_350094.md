# 20200214 stuck block 350094

if you're experiencing issues with your masternode due to recent chain split at block 350094 you may want to solve with the following steps.

**1. VERIFY VPS BLOCKHASH**

First, let's verify if your masternode is actually on wrong chain:

On your vps enter the following command:

```bash
~/sin-cli getbestblockhash && curl -s "https://blockbook.sinovate.io/api/v2" | grep -Po '"bestBlockHash":.*?[^\\]",' | cut -c "18-" | cut -d \" -f 1
```

You should get 2 outputs, exactly the same.

If you get a different output, your masternode is on different chain or stuck.

Before proceeding, make sure you're running the latest daemon version on your vps. Enter the following command:

```bash
~/sin-cli -version
```

you should get:

```text
SIN RPC client version v0.17.1.5-ec78b3b
```

If running the latest version, proceed to step 2. In case you have a different version, update it:

```bash
crontab -r
sudo systemctl stop sinovate.service
./sin-cli stop
sudo rm .sin/debug.log
wget -O daemon.tar.gz https://github.com/SINOVATEblockchain/SIN-core/releases/latest/download/daemon.tar.gz
tar -xzvf daemon.tar.gz
./sin-cli -version
SIN RPC client version v0.17.1.5-ec78b3b   //You should see//
sudo reboot
```

**2. VERIFY LOCAL WALLET BLOCKHASH**

Before proceeding, make sure you're running the latest local wallet version.

```text
v0.17.1.5-ec78b3b
```

Other than the masternode, also the local wallet must be correctly synced in order to successfully restart your masternode.

From the wallet top menu, click on `Help` then on `Debug Window` and `Console`. Enter the following command:

```text
getblockhash 350704
```

the response should be:

```text
d85a0b95f2642d29eafb3c7b40a80b22dce86baae67812ed7b3293c908b589fe
```

If your local wallet is correctly synced, than proceed to step 3. If not correctly synced, you need to _reindex_ the local blockchain data. Follow the steps at: [https://github.com/SINOVATEblockchain/SIN-core/wiki/SIN-windows-wallet:-resync](https://github.com/SINOVATEblockchain/SIN-core/wiki/SIN-windows-wallet:-resync)

**3. REINDEX MASTERNODE BLOCKCHAIN DATA**

If during step "**1. VERIFY VPS BLOCKHASH**" you found your masternode being on different chain or stuck, you need to _reindex_ blockchain data.

```bash
crontab -r
sudo systemctl stop sinovate.service
~/sind -reindex
watch -n 2 '~/sin-cli getblockcount && ~/sin-cli masternode status && ~/sin-cli mnsync status'
```

Wait until you get the following message. \(It may take up to 30 minutes. CTRL+C to exit monitoring\)

```text
"AssetName": "MASTERNODE_SYNC_FINISHED"
```

When sync finished, compare again the blockhash. It should be the same now:

```bash
~/sin-cli getbestblockhash && curl -s "https://blockbook.sinovate.io/api/v2" | grep -Po '"bestBlockHash":.*?[^\\]",' | cut -c "18-" | cut -d \" -f 1
```

**4. START MASTERNODE FROM LOCAL WALLET**

Before restarting the masternode from local wallet, make sure to have your local wallet closed and add the following preferential nodes in your `sin.conf` file located at `%appdata%\SIN`. If you don't have the file, manually create it.

Add at the end of the file the following lines.

```text
addnode=88.198.108.224
addnode=95.216.140.124
addnode=149.28.109.29
addnode=104.248.4.79
addnode=157.245.166.223
addnode=206.189.147.193
addnode=167.172.42.45
addnode=138.197.135.125
addnode=78.47.70.253
```

As a last step, remove the following files from the SIN folder:

```text
infinitynode.dat
mncache.dat
mnpayments.dat
```

Open your local wallet and wait until is fully synced, including the "additional header data" sync process.

Now select your masternode from the Infinity Node tab and **start alias**.

Enter the following command on your vps:

```bash
watch -n 2 '~/sin-cli getblockcount && ~/sin-cli masternode status && ~/sin-cli mnsync status'
```

You should see the status change to:

```text
"status": "Masternode successfully started"
```

In about 10-30 minutes your masternode should change from status PRE\_ENABLED to ENABLED. You can check the status on your local wallet but much better checking via vps:

```bash
~/sin-cli masternodelist full | grep "YOUR_VPS_IP_ADDRESS"
```
