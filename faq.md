**What is an Infinity Node?**
Infinity nodes are SINOVATE's custom collateralized service nodes, somewhat similar to masternodes. However, the features and economic differences are enormous.

**What does the infinity node do?**
Infinity nodes provide blockchain with calculations, security checks, sync data for peers, cloud storage, and other server features. 

**Do I need to keep the computer on to keep the wallet running and receive the rewards?**
You can start an Infinity node on your own hosted server(wallet must be open 24/7) or simply use "1-click in-wallet setUP" hosting. That is all that is needed, and there is no need to run the wallet or keep it open if you run it on 1-click setUP.

**Do Sinovate blockchain have nodes limit?**
Nodes limit is more like ROI limit; unique Sinovate "Burn" system lowers nodes count every year, fewer nodes, and more ROI. You can see the upcoming expired nodes timeline from the official explorer.

**What is ROI?**
Return on Investment.
ROI is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of several different investments. 
ROI tries to directly measure the return on a particular investment relative to the investment's cost.

**What is Burn system?**
SINOVATE Burn means Infinity nodes collateral (1 000 000 SIN coins, for example) Burned in exchange "BurnTx". No one can use them after Burn; you also can see the total burned amount from the explorer.
With this "BurnTx" you will have, you can start Infinity node, and they will provide you with rewards for every X block (every day); rewards are burned coins + more, in a 1-year time limit. 
"BurnTx" is limited to one year; this unique burn system is an excellent fight against inflation. The investors can not sell all at any time like masternodes, nothing to sell - collateral burned.

**Why my node do not have rewards or blocks count stuck, stopped?**
The nodes are made to protect the blockchain, deliver calculated data and support blockchain with server hardware to peers; every day, hackers try to attack the chain, and because of this, rewards can be lost. We fix and improve blockchain code every day. If your server hardware is acceptable to deliver data in time, it is possible that the node was attacked and got stuck; the node simply needs to be restarted or re-synched. Many blockchain updates have already been released, and more will come with anti-attack improvements and fixes. 

**With the release of triple-security hybrid consensus, all the future attacks will have no effect!**

**My node status seems OK, but I do not have rewards !**
Please make sure your wallet is the latest version and has the actual block count.
