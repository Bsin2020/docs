Below you will see two different ways to install the testnet wallet.  
  
  
  
Quick: you must copy sin.conf to SIN directory, remove infinitynode.conf and run testnet wallet.

  
  
  
  

Other way:

  

Step 1. Download Testnet Wallet and the sin.conf file.  
  
Step 2. To save your current main net wallet - just find your current SIN data folder that can be found by typing %appdata% in the address box  
  
User / Appdata / Roaming

Step 3. And rename it from SIN to anything you would like. Example “SINtestnet”. I have changed mine to SINmarketing in this example. (pic below)

Step 4. Your original SIN folder has been changed like the example below.

Step 5. Launch the Testnet Wallet that you downloaded in Step 1.  
  
  
Step 6. When the wallet launches and loads up, close it down after 1 minute.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
Step 7. Locate a new SIN folder (Follow the same instructions in Step 2 if you need) which should be just above your SIN folder that you changed the name of.

Step 8  Copy sin.conf to SIN directory

  

Step 9.  Launch the Testnet wallet again and check it out all the new changes we have made.  
  
  
  
**If you want to revert back to your own wallet, then simply remove the new SIN and rename the old SINmarketing folder again like you did in “Step 3” back to SIN. Make sure you use the original SIN.exe when launching your original version and not the testnet version.
