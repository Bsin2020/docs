# Staking, How?
    

For staking to take place, it is required to:

1.  Have SIN coins
    
2.  Unlock the wallet before staking.
    
3.  Keep the wallet open at all times; otherwise, it is not possible to stake it even if the coins are matured.

First, select the "Staking" menu to show the Staking page. Next, click the Stake button on the right. After reading the warning, click Yes and enter the passphrase, tick "unlock for staking only" box for staking activation.

**IMPORTANT:** The Staking menu Stake button must be turned on for staking activation. The wallet must be online 24/7 for the staking to work.

**setstakingstatus status ( "wallet" )**

Sets staking status to either true or false. If no wallet is specified, staking is enabled for the wallet which executed the RPC call.
If a wallet is specified, staking is enabled for that wallet and that wallet only. Automatically disables staking for the other wallet(s).
Arguments:
1. status    (boolean, required) The status for staking, either true or false.
2. wallet    (string, optional) The name of the wallet to enable staking for.

Result:

```
{                           (json object)
  "wallet" : "str",         (string) Wallet chosen
  "status" : true|false     (boolean) Applied status
}
```
```

setstakingstatus false my_wallet

{
  "wallet": "my_wallet",
  "status": false
}
```

```

setstakingstatus true my_wallet

{
  "wallet": "my_wallet",
  "status": true
}
```
ðŸ’¡setstakingstatus is equivalent to the GUI switch
