>  4. Once determined, select your preferred payment plan from the drop-down menu. Annually paid contract plans are the most economical per month at $2.99 monthly if paid in full at $35.88 (SIN only payment). The monthly contract price is $4.79. The SIN price paid for hosting is equivalent to the USD price of the contract.

   :warning: **Please make sure to have enough extra funds for the hosting!**

  - SINOVATE infinitynode setUP is now complete. The block confirmation speed, invoice payment, and the SIN coin burning process will take between 3 and 10 minutes. The node will appear on the infinitynodes tab after 55 blocks.



  

It really is that simple; with just a few clicks, would-be network participants will earn considerable passive income for up to a year. In addition, the SINOVATE setUP provides the perfect opportunity to reassess your VPS needs at competitive prices paid in SIN for community members who have previously set up an infinity node.
