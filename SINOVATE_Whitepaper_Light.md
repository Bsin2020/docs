# 1- Introduction

âA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.â

# 2. Our View

Since its inception in September 2018, the SINOVATE project has strived to deliver innovative solutions in the blockchain space. A complete democratic solution was created by respecting and taking on board opinions from the community. Ultimately, the community is the most critical aspect of any blockchain project. It is vital for all members of the community to feel welcome and appreciated.

SINOVATE has a different perspective on how to utilize blockchain technology to improve private and corporate parties.

The goal is to create a blockchain platform in which the community's needs are accommodated while learning from past mistakes and misfortune. SINOVATE is committed to transparency, accountability, and honesty as they strive to solve existing problems within the blockchain technology space. As succinctly put by the slogan; create, build, and innovate.

  

# 3. Our Mission

Building and improving upon trusted and proven aspects of blockchain, the SINOVATE team is aware of future challenges. Blockchain technology is still considered by many to be in its early stages of development. The implications are far-reaching and extend beyond the traditional use of cryptocurrency as a store of value.

SINOVATE is a technically sound decentralized open-source network formed by a combination of pre-existing and innovative blockchain technologies. This combination is tailor-fit to overcome the challenges of scalability, security, and ingenuity. SINOVATE is ready to adapt, evolve, and sustain its relevance in a continually changing environment.

Therefore, our goal is to launch SINOVATE innovations in combination with a user-friendly platform to be fully integrated into the userâs daily life.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/df9zSWcHXXP1minjgJlYSgWD-nOjiEKlDVUP6-VXOSQim7IEIMGO_GRVsLJ8Cjuau9e4nm_pOM7lowq3huSy-Uc2l9EF3GhpC-uFjm8NgW4JxDwzEg8urWzjjKgWbDKeWj5BKWwc)

## 4.1 Centralized

Centralized cloud storage is the hub of stored files, data, and databases administered within computing servers over a network. Cloud storage is also known as networked storage and utterly different from storing data locally.

All cloud storage options use the same underlying architecture. They all sync or copy to a centralized cloud server cluster. The owner of the centralized storage provider has complete control over the stored data.

## 4.2 Stability

Cloud storage platforms do their best to accommodate stable performance, but the achievement that can be seen from most cloud providers is regularly problematic. They often provide unstable performance throughout usage. This problem is primarily due to conclusively sharing physical resources, such as network, memory, disk, CPUs, with many different users and requirements. Furthermore, users are not able to retrieve their data where the data centers are temporarily offline for maintenance.

## 4.3 Expensive

The costs of centralized storage are inevitably expensive, including employee salaries, accounting expenses, legal charges, administration duties, and data center rents. The increasing demands of data storage help centralized solutions to reduce their renting price during the last decade by optimizing their data centers and absorbing a consequent market share. Hence, novel companies cannot concur in the market of the centralized cloud without an honorable quality of services. Additionally, the cost of data migration between different centralized cloud storage platforms is high, and the cybersecurity measures cannot fully prevent network hacks. Recently, decentralized solutions known as Cloud 3.0 show the possibility to push the limits of this universe. The decentralization reduces considerably the deployment of data storage servers of novel companies and achieves lower rent costs.

## 4.4 Privacy

The centralized cloud storage exposes your data to privacy leaks and data breaches. The management can control, monitor, censor, or provide data to third parties, and the stored data could be lost or modified. Despite laws, the data are not yours.

## 4.5 Speed

File transfer speeds are critical to cloud storage, especially when dealing with large files.

The data communication speed of centralized storage is slow since the centralized cloud server is located in a remote area, which is far away from the users, making its data transmission speed considerably slower.

## 4.6 Security

Centralized storage servers have several security issues. They usually gather in one or several places to reduce costs and thus, a physical attack could disrupt the services easily or steal the data. On the occasion of a power interruption or other malfunction, a substantial amount of related services often fail or even have the danger of losing the data forever. Finally, a data center can be easily located in the network and is easier to target for hackers.

# 5. SINOVATE

Blockchain Cloud Storage

SINOVATE (SIN) is a technically sound, open-source, and community-driven public blockchain for answering Big Data paradigms.

Incorruptible Data Storage (I.D.S.) provides decentralized cloud storage, leveraging thousands of Infinity Nodes (Evolved Masternodes) that are low cost and highly secure.

Combining both the Proof-of-Work (PoW) layer with the uniqueness of the Infinity Node coin burning system delivers a robust standard of security in the blockchain space.

SINOVATE did not have an ICO, no pre-sale of coins, and no coins were pre-mined.

# 6. Features

SINOVATE stands out from the crowd of data storage technologies thanks to six major key features.

## 6.1 Decentralization

Nowadays, SINOVATE is a distributed ledger using Infinity Nodes and GPU-oriented PoW to ensure a fair decentralization. The project is tending to a hybrid consensus for block validations fusing PoW, Infinity Nodes, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This choice encourages CPU/GPU mining and allows staking from the core wallets to reach a broader user base. Continuously more than 1250 nodes connected to the blockchain toward comprehensive decentralization, security, and stability.

## 6.2 Security

The Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) difficulty retargeting algorithm and Reorg fork reject solution merged with Proof-of-Burn (PoB) mechanism establish a secure 51% attack protection. The SINOVATE network is more immune to hash power fluctuations as witnessed, or can be potentially the case, with other blockchain projects. Block times will be more consistent and less susceptible to spikes in hash power.

Another implemented solution for 51% attack prevention is the Reorg 55 block Solution coming from the Ravencoin project.

Finally, the hybrid consensus makes it virtually impossible for successful network attacks and double-spending.

## 6.3 Governance

Revolving Sovereignty Votes (R.S.V.) enhanced e-governance designed to put power in the hands of users with yearly revolving votes. R.S.V. provides voting rights to Infinity Node holders. Decentralized governance is the future of any successful Blockchain project. SINOVATE believes that blockchain is ubiquitous in the underlying infrastructure and services in the future of everyday life. Having fair voting for developments, marketing, and innovations of the SINOVATE chain is vital for everyone.

SIN node owners can participate in the voting for the life of their nodes, which is 365 days, so users who wish to continue gaining interest while having a right to vote must have a SIN node.

## 6.4 Stability

PoB mechanism and Deterministic Infinity Nodes ensure unique one of a kind network stability and fair rewards. Infinity nodes encourage the creation of new nodes by rewarding them but also limit inflation and even the full control of its economy.

The 12 month lifetime ensures a more exceptional service quality for I.D.S. cloud storage, as operators must maintain their nodes at all times. Unlike other masternode projects, there is no canceling of nodes before the maturity date, meaning that all nodes must remain online for 12 months, which guarantees full redundancy and sustainability.

## 6.5 Transparency and Support

Unprecedented full-time active community support and openness throughout all channels of SINOVATE.

Since its origin in September 2018, the SINOVATE project has strived to deliver innovative solutions in the blockchain space. Respecting and taking the opinions of the members for genuinely democratic decisions was the primary purpose. After all, the community is the most critical aspect of the project.

SINOVATE is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and the Infinity Node ownersâ votes rule all governance decisions.

  
  
  
  
  

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PD1GPLBRJQaxJnmcF0-UH7mKXnpLF8Nd7qgQeMKTjBbNf5ny19Vvk7GULFc3qxKIOvcIdHmErDygXKx_SBE3Soy48pEkcfILLfBUBcr2GiYhRyum28pAYWoKS4eBS5vcl1oOHfhz)

## 6.6 Scalability

The SINOVATE blockchain is scalable up to 533 tx/s, due to its 16 MB maximum block size. Block times are currently 2 minutes, with exchange confirmations set to 55. The hybrid consensus will significantly reduce confirmation times for the exchanges because of being extra secure. However, a distributed consensus does not increase scalability, and this is dependent on the blockchain design.

  

Therefore, SINOVATE will integrate sharding and schnorr signatures which authorizes very high scalability and further increases the on-chain capability. However, higher scalability and throughput are necessary if the whole world uses the chain more than Bitcoin. It is why SINOVATE is compatible with all the technological features such as Lightning Network (LN). Until that time, enjoy the âlightningâ-fast transactions of the SINOVATE blockchain with its primary features.

# 7. Innovations & Solutions

## 7.1 SINOVATE Infinity Nodes

  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MTvO222Xc1fdDr2iiiXoPkTIA6Yf95ZEyJs52fMNETdqdtBvDCXOg_T8hjlZHteVuqA9Njv9WnlPtp3_ng74Fu3ZlzpnnOvxZI1GeW1TGMl-kZBJ1fE14ZZuhecuVNZFnJZ81QOv)

SINOVATE designed Infinity Nodes to overcome the hyperinflation that many cryptocurrency projects face and to open a new era of Proof-of-Services (PoSe). Setting up Infinity Nodes is based on the PoB mechanism which offers complete security and stability.

Nodes are fundamental to how blockchains function to ensure network integrity. They are vital components of a decentralized network protocol. Simply put, they are computers or servers on which wallet client software operates.

Similar to how other blockchains work, the main SIN blockchain relies upon hundreds of nodes dispersed across the globe without concern for borders or jurisdiction. Each node hosts a replicated copy of the main SIN blockchain.

Infinity Nodes provide bespoke functions such as storing data that simple nodes cannot deliver. The following sections delve deeper into this aspect of SINOVATE.

### 7.1.1 What is an Infinity Node?

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AXoWIhBEKzIlAOoy7Js4SDxOQssc39PiFaxdUiGvFJ4vlGvBN7X12bwFsnKeYnNNzSAGzYAUwaUbibmsDfC5pHYYm8obVSrkt7voYdveRMoRfisX3lWfUs3jRa7wvT9j-t4i9_q5)

  
  

Infinity Nodes are similar to traditional masternodes implemented by other cryptocurrency projects but have been designed differently for SINOVATE. They help to support the network by granting their holders additional bespoke features.

Like simple nodes, a full copy of the main SIN blockchain is replicated by the Infinity Node holder, who is regularly rewarded daily with SIN coins as compensation for the services provided.

Therefore, it is an alternative means to acquire SIN coins besides the PoW mining layer.

  
  

### 7.1.2 Multi-Tiered Infinity Nodes

There are three different tiers of Infinity Nodes available for users of the SINOVATE network. It is described as an evolution of previously implemented masternode technology by other blockchain projects. Each tier or layer provides different functions, but they all increase the overall decentralization and stability of the network.

  

Each tier requires a different amount of SIN coins for creating an Infinity Node:

-   MINI Tier: 100,000 SIN coins
    
-   MID Tier: 500,000 SIN coins
    
-   BIG Tier: 1,000,000 SIN coins
    

The SIN coins exploited for the starting of Infinity Nodes require to be transferred to an unspendable SIN wallet address which is one of the major functions of the PoB mechanism. For full transparency, you can find below the unspendable address:

  

SinBurnAddress123456789SuqaXbx3AMC

  

### 7.1.3 Infinity Node Security

Infinity Nodes are responsible for securely transferring SIN coins from one peer to another. Randomized several nodes utilize the pseudo-random ordering based algorithm by using the hash from each block.

The PoW mining layer provides the underlying security with advanced LWMA difficulty targeting algorithm and a reorg solution of 55 blocks fork rejection to the main SIN blockchain. To be specific, selected groups of ten ranked nodes carry out the process.

  

## 7.2 DETERMINISTIC INFINITY NODE 1.0

As previously covered, an Infinity Node is an improved version of a conventional masternode implemented by the DASH cryptocurrency. There are still many similarities between both in the first cycle of Infinity Nodes. Going forward, SINOVATE Infinity Nodes will differentiate entirely from the DASH masternode code, and SINOVATE will become the first of its kind, a pure platform known as Deterministic Infinity Node (DIN) 1.0.

  

### 7.2.1 What differentiates DIN 1.0 and MasterNodes technology?

The DIN 1.0 Platform will provide the SINOVATE public blockchain with:

  

Â· A more secure and efficient network protocol.

Â· A more streamlined network experience. Less CPU utilization and less network communication.

Â· The elimination of discovered security flaws found in the masternode code.

Â· The revolution of on-chain node structures.

Â· A purely custom-built code different from masternodes.

Â· Infinity Nodes will communicate on-chain (no need to start alias)

  

1) Schnorr based Multi-Signature signing scheme (MuSig)

2) Provably fair and openly verifiable fully deterministic node rewards

3) Inflation control with a burn-to-run node ecosystem

4) Fully on-chain node registration and servicing

5) Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) with node democracy

6) Node incentives ensure sustainability

There are many benefits of the DIN 1.0 Code.

- 100% fair rewards because of the in-house deterministic algo

- On-Chain fast speed communications and the wallet will use very few CPU resources, no need to wait for synchronization.(instant)

-Node setup will be in couple of minutes without a config file, collateral deposit or start alias needs

- Using Schnorr MuSig signatures instead of BLS signatures will make everything faster, more scalable but also lighter because of the small size of the Schnorr signatures.

  
  

Soon, the first phase of the transition will involve the simultaneous operation of both the DIN 1.0 and masternode code. A complete transition to the sole DIN 1.0 Platform will occur as soon as set requirements are met. It will result in the deletion of all legacy masternode code from the SINOVATE code base.

## 7.3 Proof-of-Burn mechanism

Infinity Node uses the PoB mechanism to ensure that all SIN coins used to set up get burnt immutably and recorded as unspendable. This process helps to increase the validity of the decentralized network and ensures all participating nodes reach consensus. This feature further secures the network by deterring bad actors who may attempt to carry out malicious activities on the network. Every node holder commits to support the network's longevity by locking and burning SIN coins in an Infinity Node for 12-months. In not doing so, they lose the rewards from the blockchain and potential ROI.

This stability requirement ensures the network's endurance and limits the coins in the circulating supply to be sold in more significant amounts, therefore reducing the selling pressure. This is not the case with traditional masternodes that can be liquidated and sold at any time.

PoB mechanism provides this same stability for future use cases of the I.D.S. cloud storage feature by storing decentralized cloud data inside infinity nodes.

## 7.4 I.D.S - Incorruptible Data Storage & Decentralized Cloud 3.0

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s_jrMtaeoO0myjo0IRk9eESys38H7zolNUYz8-Do_Hdd9N_NmhpWVuin-UMSCoFWcQsdk0GXaIKop1uU_rJQQJZgUYuCDHxJR9KbqKIXvs6pz3xt04MYQ8GET1q7crLEmWH7muFx)

Incorruptible Data Storage (I.D.S.) is an innovatively designed SINOVATE decentralized cloud and private network mechanism for sending, storing, and verifying encrypted data files. It allows users to store files for future retrieval and to send files peer-2-peer anonymously. It also allows private messaging between users with SIN messenger application to guarantee security without storing data on any server.

-   Decentralized Cloud 3.0
    
-   DataSend and DataStore
    
-   Blockchain-mail and Proof-of-Integrity
    
-   Unlimited private networking of big data storage
    
-   SIN Messenger Direct Messaging
    

### 7.4.1 How Does I.D.S Work?

The I.D.S (Step-1) feature uses the âMINI SINâ Infinity Node Layer and blockchain architecture to process and store data files.

  

What follows are the steps a user must follow to use I.D.S:

-   Upload a copy of the document or message to the core qt wallet or mobile application.
    
-   Send the data to the âMINI SINâ Infinity Node Layer for temporary storage.
    
-   Infinity Nodes validate the data transaction
    
-   After two confirmations, the data stored and indexed permanently in the âMINI SINâ Layer get broadcasted across the decentralized network protocol. Users can compare a local copy with the recorded copy to provide proof of ownership.
    

  

Data is stored and encrypted using the public key of the data owner. For future retrieval, the transaction ID and proof of authenticity (private key) are necessary to access the Infinity Nodes data. In the future, third party logical access control will be added as a feature to allow third-party access if demanded.

To avoid blockchain bloat, a user has to pay a SIN transaction fee to store data. The amount paid depends on the size of the data and its level of encryption. All transaction fees are burnt and removed from the SIN coin circulation supply.

The mainnet SINOVATE blockchain and the âMINI SINâ layer store the metadata.

It is then saved in levelDB and indexed, but only the data owner can view and utilize the data for verification.

  

### 7.4.2 I.D.S. DataStore

DataStore allows users to store digital documentation or data, timestamped with metadata, and secured by the incorruptible SIN blockchain.

A local copy of the document or data is available to compare with that stored in the blockchain at any time. SINOVATE cryptography and the blockchain provide the underlying trust and empirical truth to enable the data stored to be validated.

Besides being able to send data, the SINOVATE network allows users to store data for specific time limits. It is important to emphasize that data is not directly transferred to a receiver but instead distributed between 20 Infinity Nodes.

  

Using Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) as the typical examples, the following applies:

  

-   When choosing Infinity Nodes to store the data, Alice can either choose nodes she trusts or uses an algorithm that randomly picks twenty nodes categorized as âlow riskâ (if Infinity Node has <70% ROI)
    
-   Data is stored in 20 nodes (including any chosen by Alice)
    
-   Alice can select more than twenty nodes to store the data, but the fee will be higher
    
-   The Infinity Nodes will store data for seven days unless a higher fee is paid for a longer time limit
    

  

### 7.4.3 SIN Messenger Direct Messaging

Using the same underlying I.D.S protocol, users can send data and documentation to each other using the trusted and secure SINOVATE blockchain to guarantee the validity of the data.

  

This provides the following unique benefits:

1.  Increased security of personal information.
    
2.  Data control back in the hands of users and recipients, with no additional storage costs.
    
3.  Privacy of data â This is paramount in the face of Facebook, Google, and other data hacks and misuse.
    
4.  Alleviation of hacking and disruptive downtime periods that centralized databases are prone to experience.
    

For example, a sender called Alice can encrypt data, then send it to Bob. Bob is then the only peer who can receive and open it.

This transfer of data utilizes the âElliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithmâ or ECDSA, which uses private/public keys and digital signatures.

  

To be specific, Alice can encrypt the data by using the public key provided by Bob before it is broadcasted via the SINOVATE network.

Only Bob has permission to decrypt the data by using his secret private key. Additionally, Bob receives a notification within the wallet client that his data is stored, for a limited time, by specific Infinity Nodes.

What follows is the process by which simple âdataâ messages can be sent from Alice to Bob:

1.  Alice sends a âregisterâ transaction with a specific SIN coin âamountâ to the wallet address SINBurnAddressForRegisterxxx
    
2.  When Alice broadcasts the âdataâ message, the chosen or randomly selected Infinity Nodes will check if Alice has permission (data size, expiration time, etc.).
    

1.  Infinity Nodes refuse the transaction if the permission is not granted.
    
2.  If granted permission, the Infinity Nodes will save the âdataâ message sent from Alice, ready for Bob to download it later on.
    

4.  Bob must prove he is the recipient by using his private key to download the âdataâ message by signing the message and then broadcasting it to the network.
    

  

### 7.4.4 Transactions

In a similar way, how SINOVATE network broadcasts financial transactions, the SIN Messenger feature uses the same type of transaction (Burn and Data) as implemented in the âInfinity Nodeâ feature.

  

Each time a user executes the message, the following metadata is recorded and saved in LevelDB:

-   Transaction ID
    
-   HashKey
    
-   How large the data file is
    
-   How long the data is stored for (time limit)
    
-   List of the IPs of the chosen or randomly selected Infinity Nodes
    

### 7.4.5 Transaction Fees

Network Fee: Each DataSend transaction costs (default minimum) 0.1 SIN to transfer data of size 1 Mb and for 7 days of storage.

Storage Fee:0.1 SIN for additional extra 1 Mb

Time Limit Fee: 0.1 SIN for an additional 7 days of storage

Once Alice has chosen what fee to pay and saved the data, the Infinity Nodes broadcast the metadata and commits the collateral. She must also send a âBurn and Dataâ transaction to the receiver (Bob) with 0 SIN sent. It contains the necessary information to permit Bob to successfully receive the data.

All five Infinity nodes, either assigned randomly or chosen, continue to verify that the data is stored for the specified time limit. The network fee is committed by the highest rank of the five nodes.

  

### 7.4.6 Proof-of-Storage

It is the responsibility of the five chosen or randomly assigned Infinity Nodes to verify that the data is stored until the time limit has expired. The highest-ranked Infinity Node commits the network fee.

-   Node A sends a random number (RN) to Node B.
    
-   Node B answer by hash (RN, data size)
    
-   Node A verifies the response of Node B.
    

-   If OK, do nothing.
    
-   If KO, create an alarm to 4 other nodes to verify and ban node B if necessary.
    

  

### 7.4.7 Proof-of-Integrity

The I.D.S feature makes it possible for users to prove the integrity of that data in addition to sending and storing data files on the blockchain. Private individuals, corporations, and governments need to be sure that the data they receive is genuine. SINOVATE will utilize proof-of-integrity to solve this problem. For example, when Alice decides to send data to Bob, Alice must create a new transaction type TX_BURN_DATA. This transaction is then included in a subsequently mined block and saved in the main SIN blockchain.

1.  <PublicKey of Bob> â this is known by Alice (required to send data to Bob)
    
2.  <OP_RETURN> â the number of SIN coins committed to the transaction will be burnt. The amount transacted is dependent on how long Infinity Nodes will store the data and which Infinity Node layer is chosen (MINI, MID, BIG)
    
3.  <SMALLDATA> â the hash of the data file (used as proof-of-integrity)
    

In summary, when the transaction and data file are sent from within a userâs wallet interface, they are both broadcast to the network. The hash data file is stored on the blockchain, and the actual data is saved on the chosen Infinity Node layer. The immutability of the hash data file proves that no-one is authorized to change it, and the data sent from Alice to Bob is authentic, whole, and trusted.

  

### 7.4.8 Summary of Data Services

In summary, the DataSend feature empowers users of the SINOVATE network. It is a highly secure method by which to send and store data. It is also possible to track the time at which the data was transferred. As the SINOVATE network expands, users will be able to âsellâ disk space, and data will not be deleted from Infinity Nodes.

Later on, the SIN InfiniteChain (completely separate from the main SIN blockchain) will be the complete solution to the constant trilemma faced by many blockchains. It will be essential to optimize the decentralization, security, and scalability of the SINOVATE blockchain as the number of users grows.

  
  

## 7.5 SINOVATE InfiniteChain

Completely separate from the main SIN blockchain, the SIN InfiniteChain will be a new blockchain built on the BIG Infinity Node Layer (BIL), which uses the proof-of-burn and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. All blocks created by BIL are transferred and relayed to all nodes of the network. Users can take advantage of high speeds, flexibility, and liquidity.

Both the main SIN blockchain and SIN InfiniteChain are closely linked. The SIN InfiniteChain provides additional functionality for users to create their customized asset tokens. An asset token can then be associated with a specific valued data file or physical good, effectively monetizing the proof of ownership of that data or good.

  

### 7.5.1 InfiniteChain/Mainnet Relation

As described above, the SIN InfiniteChain will be utilized to create customized token assets that can be assigned to innumerable physical goods or digital data files in the real-world. For instance, a token asset can be assigned to grant ownership to a piece of valuable fine art, as described earlier. It is then only the token asset holders who have access to it.

### 7.5.2 Transactions and Blocks

  

Considering the SIN InfiniteChain, only the âDeviseâ transaction type is accepted.

What follows are some details of the âDeviseâ Transaction:

-   The unique identity of Devise - In the new system, each âDeviseâ has a unique identity. Today, SIN coin has a DeviseID 100000. New coins on the SIN InfiniteChain (SSIN) have a DeviseID 100001. The user of the new system can create a new âDeviseâ (asset creation) with an ID greater or equal to 100002.
    
-   New standard name - DEVISE_TX - For âseparatingâ the transaction in mainnet and InfiniteChain, a new transaction standard is present in the network: DEVISE_TX.
    
-   New OP_DEVISEID / OP_CHECKDEVISE - OP_DEVISEID is a number representing the unique identity of a âDeviseâ on the network. OP_CHECKDEVISE is used to make sure that: The âDeviseâ is the same as the previous transaction and that Tx is FALSE if the âDeviseâ relation is incorrect.
    

  

Every user on the network receives two versions (type) of the block from the main SIN blockchain and SIN InfiniteChain. The system controls the blocks received before connecting to the local blockchain. What follows are the conditions to validate the blocks:

-   The main SIN blockchain - If the second transaction of the block in the mainnet is a Coinbase transaction, the system checks all blocks N-21 of SIN InfiniteChain and verifies both the amount and the user who burnt coins in the SIN InfiniteChain.
    
-   SIN InfiniteChain - If the first transaction of the block in the SIN InfiniteChain is a Coinbase transaction, and the block is the first block related with block N-21 in the mainnet, and there is a user who burnt coin to create an asset at block N-21, the block is considered as âvalid.â

### 7.5.3 SINOVATE Asset Creation

Blockchain technology was initially designed to improve how financial transactions are verified and recorded. Over time, the use cases have expanded. It is possible to leverage blockchain technology to tokenize physical goods by creating token assets. This provides a useful tool for seamlessly exchanging and storing legal ownership of goods on an immutable distributed ledger. Each tokenized asset will, therefore, have an associated value depending on what it represents in the real-world.

Tokenized assets are an excellent method by which to prove who owns the corresponding physical good. It is easy to transfer the ownership peer-to-peer without future disputes or the worry of records becoming maliciously altered. It offers potential new trading markets which were not possible with traditional centralized technology or infrastructure.

SINOVATE plans to deliver asset tokenization in the future according to set roadmap goals. It will be facilitated by the SIN InfiniteChain part of the network.

  

## 7.6 The X25X Proof-of-Work Algorithm

  

â Leading-edge and in-house built

â Custom GPU mining algorithm

â More complex

â Less power-hungry

  

To protect and enhance the decentralization of the SINOVATE blockchain, a leading-edge custom proof-of-work hashing algorithm was innovatively developed and implemented. The X25X algorithm is a brand new algorithm best suited for GPU mining. It is also ASIC, FPGA, and Quantum resistant with the addition of SWIFFTX to the algorithm chain. Ultimately, the X25X hashing algorithm prevents large mining operations or farms from dominating the SINOVATE blockchain. It is praised for being a very secure, fair, decentralized, and highly accessible method by which to mine SIN coins.

The X25X is an excellent example of how SINOVATE is evolving blockchain technology.

The purpose of the original X25X whitepaper was to design a proof of work algorithm that could provide the best possible combination of the following points:

1.  Make ASIC and FPGA design much more difficult and expensive
    
2.  Allow GPU optimised miners to be developed quickly
    
3.  Allow GPU miners to have maximum efficiency
    
4.  Add quantum resistance
    
5.  Use components which are proven, industry standard algorithms, like sha-2 and sha-3, for best security

## 7.7 SINOVATE 51% Attack & Security Measures

### 7.7.1 ï¿¸Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

Difficulty adjustment algorithms have been designed, tested, and implemented to improve the way in which the mining difficulty responds to fluctuating network hash power, however small or large.

More recently, more advanced difficulty adjustment algorithms have been released and adopted after meticulous testing phases. SINOVATE has been at the forefront by integrating the latest difficulty algorithms into their code protocol. In particular, the LWMA Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm is being used to solve 51% attacks and functions as follows:

It estimates the current hash rate in order to set the difficulty to get the correct solve times by dividing the harmonic mean of the difficulties by the Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA) of the solve times. It gives more weight to the most recent solve times. It is designed for small coin protection against timestamp manipulation and hash attacks. The basic equation is:

next_difficulty = harmonic_mean(Difficulties) * target_solvetime / LWMA(solve times)

  

### 7.7.2 REORG Depth Solution & Fork Rejection

Another method to counteract 51% double-spend attacks is known as Default Maximum Reorg Depth Solution. A sufficient number of trusted nodes or computer servers communicate with each other to prevent a forked chain from becoming maliciously accepted as the âhonestâ chain.â

This is achieved by setting a maximum number of preceding blocks from which forked chains can be formed, either valid or malicious. A low maximum reorg depth solution is not recommended as it will deter valid chain forks.

  
  
  

## 7.8 SINOVATE Document Verification (S.D.V.)

As is still sadly prevalent in many aspects of daily life, false documents are often fraudulently created, transferred, and presented to individuals, businesses, or governments. They can be easily mistaken as genuine copies. It is cumbersome for parties to identify the real copies due to time constraints or oversight. The demand for systems that solve fraudulent activity is increasing year on year.

Blockchain technology has an integral part to play in proving the legitimacy and ownership of documents. It has the unique ability to timestamp and store data files in an immutable manner. Decentralized document verification will transform the way documents are accessed, transferred, verified, and stored with the aid of public/private key cryptography.

Birth certificates, marriage documentation, court proceedings, employment contracts, and official legal agreements are some use cases. The SIN blockchain is a useful tool to facilitate the process.

The SINOVATE I.D.S feature can be used to securely store and control access to data files stored on the SIN network. It is a proven way to encrypt data and prove ownership of that same data. People can verify the authenticity of the data on the blockchain by comparing it with a locally stored copy.

# 9-Tracking the Evolution

SINOVATEâs evolution will initially depend on user growth generation. The platform is designed to scale rapidly under the influence of demand-side economies of scale and cross-side network effects.

SINOVATE intends to utilize the potential increase in SIN transaction volume and scalability to develop features to enhance network user experience further.

Moreover, there are plans afoot to expand the business model by forming partnerships and relationships, to connect different ecosystems.

Below describes the features in the first SINOVATE Improvement Proposal (SIP):

SIP 01: On-chain Data for Tracking Infinity nodes:

SIN Node list can be extracted easily from blockchain by using the Burn Address:

In the Coinbase Tx of block N, pay "winner" of block N+1 from winner List:

BIG SIN (X): 0.001000352 (352 is number of votes for X in block N+1)

MID SIN (Y): 0.000500367

MINI SIN (Z): 0.000100768

  

In the validation step of block N, add the following check:

1. Extract the list "on-chain" masternode (L) and verify the payout of Coinbase for BIG SIN (A), MID SIN (B), MINI SIN (C) ===> A, B, C must be in list L.

2. Users can then check the A, B, and C "winner" who are paid in block N-1 (like X Y Z).

A node coming online after a fork:

1. Load "missing" block data from other nodes (where at block N):

+ for each block, the checkpoints 1 and 2

2. Get the list of winners from other nodes ([N-20 to N+20])

+ from block N+1, then all checks are done (1 2 and 3).

Advantage of this solution:

- On-chain data

- No need to change the block header (like DIP03 deterministic node of Dash), so stay compatible with bitcoin.

- Miner of block N cannot negatively influence because it is not their decision (miner of block N-1 decided)

- Attackers must have two pools and mine two blocks consecutively if they want to influence the network (probability is minimal) negatively

- The network is secure and verifiable

- Users can check the next block payment winner list and that X Y Z is compatible with the network consensus and add the block or not (ban miner).

- SIN nodes control the block mined and validate it. If a miner is cheating, the SIN node forms a consensus to ban the miner from the network.

This can be compared to DIP 03 of Dash.

This resolves the issue of all masternode networks and creates a so-called "trustless miner."

  

## 9.1 Evolution of Innovation

The large, talented SINOVATE development team aims to continue innovating unique features in the blockchain technology space. As mentioned previously, Infinity Nodes have brought significant improvements in masternode security and blockchain economics.

SINOVATE utilizes sandbox environments to test new features and ideas. Both the sandboxes and testnet simulate market and network conditions. It is a beneficial process during which the primary SIN code protocol can be thoroughly tested before official releases. Several innovations are currently on the horizon, including the SIN InfiniteChain, Deterministic Infinity Nodes, and Hybrid Consensus.

  

# 10- Tokenomics

As things currently stand, about 5,000 different types of cryptocurrencies (coins and tokens) are officially recognized, either active or dormant, with different structures and models. It is interesting to know what impacts the value of a particular coin or token. The native cryptocurrency or, the layer one token (SIN) of the main SIN blockchain is discussed in detail below.

## 10.1 What is Tokenomics?

As applied to blockchain technology, tokens serve to represent something of value in the real-world. It could be tangible goods, services, data, information, company shares, voting rights, and so on. Tokenomics is a term formed by merging the words âtokenâ and âeconomicsâ together. It is the term used to study the quality standard of a token to determine whether it has underlying value, a high potential adoption rate, investor interest, and long-term sustainability. Put, it helps potential token holders decide what will impact that tokenâs value, real-world utility, and longevity.

Tokenomics is a broad subject, which consists of a variety of components. It is advisable for people seeking to invest in and maybe participate in a tokenâs growth, to study its tokenomics in detail.

  

## 10.2 What Impacts a Token Value?

When studying the quality standard of a token, potential participants or investors have to consider different aspects of its structure or model. It is vital to investigate aspects such as token allocation, business model, team, and community.

  
  
  
  
  

### ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GN9GqfD3Zs4JO5Uy-qQeJMDB7zQoSNcRjiSM29fTiELJ4ny70Q7dgDn2X94jsnWlnYV8FQFI9BHUfYC79715tQWRsIr9zGmdUzFAx6cKVafndnZpMmN0-0Zz9i71-7ZRcaXqK7BZ)

  
  

According to Metcalfeâs law theory;

âThe more people in the network, the more value the network will have.â

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RFfKBtrxT0JeggD6toVX-dxVO0X5dfeBAXT7hrHrbRPxGAx8PIv3i3t1_P-AfOVbC6TvDSU7RI4OXj5C7rdTqwIhxzHq7teblqU7-V7euBcEtQmecCRLvf0Ly685Q4fJfEyJHcpx)

## 10.3 Token Allocation

Token allocation refers to how tokens are distributed immediately after the launch of a blockchain. It also encompasses how newly generated tokens are rewarded and allocated during the lifespan of that blockchain. The community needs to be transparently informed about where funds are being held and what these funds are used for. For instance, some core teams hold custody over a development and marketing fund.

Formerly launched as SUQA in 2018, the initial SIN tokens were fairly distributed by mining to members of the community. There was no ICO (Initial Coin Offering) or pre-sale of tokens.

There are three ways SIN tokens are allocated; proof-of-work mining, Infinity Nodes, and the Development & Marketing Fund. SINOVATE is devoted to complete transparency regarding how the Development & Marketing Fund is spent. It ensures that the project is self-funded adequately in terms of sustainable code development, prolonged marketing, and other beneficial operational activities.

## 10.4 Business Model

SINOVATE has innovatively designed, tested, and implemented a variety of products and services into its decentralized network protocol. Besides helping to streamline processes for other third party entities, the SINOVATE project is aligning itself to become one of the most trusted, adaptable, secure, transparent, efficient, and reliable decentralized networks in the blockchain technology space.

  

A robust business model is continuously evolving to differentiate SINOVATE from other blockchain-based projects on the market.

  

-   Infinity Nodes support bespoke functionalities and secure the network. All three tiers of Infinity Node holders receive regular rewards as an incentive for competently running their nodes for 12 months and storing confidential data files. All SIN tokens used to create Infinity Nodes are burnt. Due to the burn feature, Infinity Node holders are committed to run their nodes for their full lifespan while controlling inflation.
    
-   Incorruptible Data Storage (I.D.S) allows users to send and store encrypted data files for specific periods. It is an essential component for the mass adoption of the SINOVATE network powered by the Infinity Node Layer. Unlimited encrypted data storage and the unlimited burnt transaction fees are the main goals of SINOVATE's business model.
    
-   Revolving Sovereignty Votes (R.S.V) infinity node-driven governance.
    
-   All transaction fees are irreversibly burnt, including the governance voting and cloud storage. Burn model helps to increase the deflationary aspect of the SIN token ecosystem. As more users join the network, fewer SIN tokens will be available, resulting in scarcity.
    

  

Going forward, the SINOVATE team plans to improve the above functionalities and implement new ones, which will attract more users.

  
  

## 10.5 Branding

Overlooked by some blockchain projects, branding is necessary to gain the attention of potential users, investors, and contributors. It can be the crucial difference between people becoming intrigued to investigate a project further or failing to be impressed.

The SINOVATE team recognized the power of branding before rebranding SUQA to SINOVATE in early 2019 which has substantially increased the professional image of the SINOVATE network.

## 10.6 Community

Simply put, a blockchain project would be nothing without a community. It is considered one of the most critical aspects that adds value to a blockchain. Each member of a community, if s/he chooses, has the opportunity to constructively suggest improvements and influence the direction in which progress proceeds.

SINOVATE has a thriving and enthusiastic community consisting of many people eager to see the project succeed. It is in the best interests of the whole project that the community is respected, listened to, and encouraged to add value to the SINOVATE network collaboratively. Ultimately, they are the users of the services and products on offer.

## 10.8 Legal Compliance

SINOVATE is committed to remain legally compliant and registered. It is crucial to be as transparent, credible and accountable as possible in order to increase user adoption.

  

## 10.9 Layer 1 vs Layer 2

In the blockchain technology space, there are different types of tokens available. They can primarily be categorized into two groups depending on what purpose they serve and their underlying structure. These are as follows:

-   Layer 1 - coins such as Bitcoin are generated and used by the main blockchain. SIN coins are classed as layer one tokens with a main blockchain.
    
-   Layer 2 - coins such as ERC20 are leveraged to bespoke power services on a layer built on top of the main blockchain. SINOVATE is looking forward to offering users the ability to create tokenized assets on the upcoming SIN InfiniteChain.
    

  
  

## 10.10 Utility vs Security

A crypto coin that does not pass the Howey Test is considered as a security token.

The SINOVATE Infinity Nodes infrastructure, R.S.V. e-Governance voting, and the use of SIN coins in I.D.S. qualifies SIN coins as utility tokens, with the legal memorandum provided by the legal advisory team.

  

## 10.11 SINOVATE System Economy

As the circulating SIN coin supply decreases, the selling pressure gets weaker on the open trading markets. SIN system economy is built upon fighting emissions while incentivising the users.

The economical system consists of:

-   Burning all the transaction fees in the network.
    
-   Burning all the Governance proposals and voting fees.
    
-   Burning the collateral coins of the infinity Nodes.
    
-   Burning all the decentralized cloud fees.

# 11- SINOVATE Use Cases

Blockchain or distributed ledger technology can impact how individuals, businesses, and governments conduct their everyday processes. There are countless potential use cases, realized and currently unforeseen, that will increase the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of operations across a broad spectrum of fields. For instance, the unique features of the blockchain (immutability, transparency, security) will serve as an invaluable tool for storing, sending, and retrieving confidential documentation. Many businesses are yearning for better ways to keep their data and information secure from malicious activity.

As covered by earlier sections, the SINOVATE network is evolving to offer third parties the useful services and products for real-world utilization. It can currently be used in conjunction with legacy systems and processes to bring cutting edge technology to many industries.

For example, decentralized cloud storage, finance, medical, insurance, education, and government sectors will be able to use SINOVATE as a better alternative.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/P5Vr8L-nlsKgiZGItiiwbWP3zgc1xqQOakLAciKXteI7ja7WpT8xr04UPs7GdxK95rhgcNM-9CgKF-Hf-HgJdZa8L_C7RSSh_Pf6Vfl1kcTl1NdkmGnwfjLMoZNTKand98f29IpA)

  

## 11.1 Decentralized Cloud & SIN Messenger & Inheritance

Cloud storage is rapidly increasing and the most promising future business. Data is the oil of the 21st century.

A definitive solution to the centralized cloud storage downfall comes in the form of blockchain technology.

Incorruptible Data Storage technology accommodates a cloud-based service model, where transferring and storing data is completely decentralized. Comparable to how the Bitcoin network uses dedicated nodes to broadcast transactions, the same model could apply to cloud storage. However, in the event of I.D.S., this is achieved by using distributed nodes where the full data is stored and distributed throughout servers and computers running all over the world, with no central point of failure.

-   SIN Messenger Direct messaging will allow complete end-to-end user encryption without storing any of the data inside any servers.
    
-   Proof-of-inheritance will transfer the legacy funds of users to their heirs safely and silently without any risk.
    

  
  

## 11.2 SINOVATE Finance Use Case

While many aspects of the financial sector have been rapidly modernizing over recent years, countless FinTech companies appear to challenge incumbent systems. These new digital companies have adopted and embraced blockchain technology to free themselves from the shackles of legacy processes.

Despite the technological advances made in the financial sector, it is evident that many processes still rely on antiquated technology. For instance, many derivatives and other financial instruments are still, ultimately, paper-based contracts. The mortgage and other sectors within the industry are heavily dependent on facsimile technology. Fax machines are still widely used by IT departments across the sector.

SINOVATE plans to revolutionize how confidential documentation is sent, stored, and managed across the globe. It will have a broad-reaching impact on the incumbent system.

### 11.2.1 SINOVATE Solution

Documents stored on the SINOVATE blockchain are entirely secure and easily accessible by the owners. Each document can be compared with a local copy to prove its authenticity and ownership at any time. Moreover, the document and metadata can be shared by the data owner. It will allow auditors to sample and verify financial institution assets. Metadata can be searched and indexed, and the proof of the underlying assets proved beyond doubt.

The Incorruptible Data Storage (I.D.S) feature of the SINOVATE network significantly reduces the cost of saving and storing documents. Financial institutions do not need to worry about specialized storage databases to store all previously collected data. It will allow them to focus more on their future operational activities, instead of allocating resources to safeguard records. The I.D.S. feature ensures that all stored documents are entirely secure and private, even in the case of economic collapse or a natural disaster.

  
  

## 11.3 SINOVATE Medical Use Case

As things currently stand, modern medicine faces a broad spectrum of challenges and issues which need addressing soon. They are very diverse and can be distinguished by the following:

1.  Untimely diagnosis of diseases.
    
2.  The rejection of new technologies due to conservative views.
    
3.  The lack of communication between specialists in different fields.
    
4.  In some cases, the impossibility of a quick consultation with several specialists due to the lack of easily accessible information shared amongst experts who required it.
    
5.  Specialists are restricted to the data they can access on centralized databases.
    
6.  The rapid aging of the population makes it essential for experts to seamlessly access, manage, and amend data.
    

  

### 11.3.1 SINOVATE Solution

After extensive analysis of the current situation in telemedicine, the SINOVATE team is confident that its blockchain services and products will complement the positive aspects of health service provision. At the same time, it will overcome some of the negative aspects and obstacles as outlined above.

SINOVATE will provide a comprehensive solution to how medical records are sent, stored, and accessed in a decentralized manner. Data files will be transparently, immutably, and securely stored for later retrieval by assigned parties such as patients, doctors, or pharmacies. The SINOVATE network will maintain a single version of patient medical records without risk of fraudulent activity. Furthermore, parties can be assigned different levels of authorization. For instance, patients, doctors, and hospitals will be able to edit medical records, whereas pharmacies and insurers will only be able to read and suggest edits. Each interaction is auditable, transparent, and secure, and will be recorded as a transaction on the main SINOVATE blockchain.

As the ultimate goal, SINOVATE is aiming to add value to the world of medicine by solving several problems that occur within it.

SINOVATE offers a comprehensive blockchain-based solution consisting of the main blockchain and the I.D.S feature. It will result in the creation of a decentralized system for blockchain medicine to improve the overall quality of care received by patients. It is anticipated that it will take medicine to the next level by:

-   Expanding the availability of patient medical records.
    
-   Improving the quality of treatment and delivering it more efficiently.
    
-   Increasing the ease with which authorized parties can access the records.
    

What follows are some of the objectives SINOVATE has concerning the medical sector:

-   To develop the I.D.S feature, patients and other authorized parties can access medical records at any time and place.
    
-   To implement the fully functional I.D.S feature ready for utilization by interested parties in the medical sector.
    
-   To research new technologies for the further creation of new services.
    

  
  

## 11.4 SINOVATE Insurance use Case

As highlighted by the finance and medical use cases, the insurance sector will also benefit from utilizing the SINOVATE blockchain to improve services and solve issues. Similar to other sectors, insurance faces challenges due to the restrictive nature of legacy systems and technology. When managing claims, a variety of different documents have to be verified and managed. This process is currently a cumbersome method involving multiple parties and significant overheads.

SINOVATE offers the insurance sector a secure method to prove the authenticity, ownership, and age of data files or documents. It will help immensely to combat fraud and help to prevent risk. It will eradicate the requirement for trusted third parties to verify whether the documentation is counterfeit or not. The SINOVATE blockchain can be used as an immutable record of timestamped insurance records. The I.D.S. feature will definitely help to streamline insurance sector practices.

### 11.4.1 SINOVATE Solution

As stated above, proof of documentation combats insurance fraud and helps to eradicate as much risk as possible. SINOVATE resolves many aspects of fraudulent activity by making it possible for insurers to easily leverage the secure, reliable, and immutable nature of its data file-sharing system. Once active, the insurance companies will be able to seamlessly access all the required data to prevent fraud from happening.

The SINOVATE network ingeniously offers a ground-breaking alternative to what software insurers currently use to spot red flags automatically. As is often the case, current systems can only spot red flags if they have adequate data to compare the claim. Insurance companies cannot retract the information from others, so the innovatively designed I.D.S feature will help to solve this. All data will be stored in one place, as one single version, on the SINOVATE network. It will be more convenient for insurers to compare data and prevent potential fraud.

Besides, the SINOVATE solution will make it easier for insurers to compare claims with similar claims made in the past. This method will prevent so-called âpadding,â which is a fraudulent method used by insurance agents or companies to pay less than required.

  

## 11.5 Government Use

Proving the authenticity and ownership of documents is vitally important in the government sector. Different government departments are over-reliant on centralized or paper-based systems that can benefit from blockchain technology. Varying degrees of infrastructure related to the administration of tax, inheritance, pensions, land registry, and so forth, can significantly be impacted on a worldwide scale.

SINOVATE is keen to offer products and services that will improve how governments send, manage, and store private documentation. It will help immensely to prove that documents are valid. Documents stored are available securely for later retrieval at any future time.

### 11.5.1 SINOVATE Solution

The Incorruptible Data Storage (I.D.S.) feature provides a basic set of tools to address the obsolescence of storage media, hardware, applications, and application-dependent data. It will also embody records, schedules and other documentation for easy integration with hierarchical storage management systems, this segregating temporary and permanent records onto the most appropriate storage medium (i.e., online, offline)

The I.D.S. feature will also provide the essential viewing and batch exporting capabilities necessary for any preservation or migration. This may be required or demanded from internal or external parties.

  

## 11.6 Education and Business Model

Once again, the I.D.S. feature will help to streamline processes and shift operations away from legacy systems. All data is securely stored on the main SIN blockchain for later retrieval. Educational institutions will no longer need to adhere to labor-intensive methods by which to send, store, or authenticate documentation. SINOVATE aims to erase all current issues that the educational institutions face. Universities, colleges, and e-learning platforms will be able to leverage the I.D.S. feature in a multitude of ways (immutability, security, high accessibility) to protect themselves against fraud, loss, or damage.

Besides many other realized and unforeseen use cases of the SINOVATE network, the education sector will need to use SIN coins to pay for the services on the main SIN blockchain. Fees will be necessary to sustain the network and make it run more smoothly for all users. It is important to note that the fees will be lower than the costs incurred by using previous legacy systems.

Over the long term, this will add value to the network and increase the credibility of the SINOVATE project.

Another advantage of fees, rather than a free service, is it will deter malicious actors from spamming the network with substantial transactional traffic. Therefore, it will mitigate against blockchain bloat and low performance. Fees will also cover potential legal costs, such as jury costs and other disputes.

SINOVATE assures its users that the services and products on offer, or to be released in the future, will function smoothly and efficiently. It will be beneficial for public and private sector bodies to investigate what the SINOVATE network offers and how it can streamline operations. Eventually, this will bring worldwide recognition and mass adoption going forward for SINOVATE blockchain.

  

## 11.7 Go Green, Go SINOVATE

By taking just one minute to look around the room to notice how many things are paper-based. There may be books, magazines, printer paper, and paper posters on the wall. However, each person in the United States of America uses 749 pounds (340kg) of paper on average every year (adding up to a whopping 187 billion pounds (85 billion kg) per year for the entire population, the realization sets in that paper manifest in many forms than meets the eye. Beyond the domestic scene, businesses and governments are relying even more on paper-based products.

Nearly 4 billion trees worldwide are cut down each year for paper, representing about 35 percent of all harvested trees.

  

### 11.7.1 SINOVATE Solution

Having the goal to stop all paper consumption would be an impossible task. Paper-based products are very prevalent and a convenient resource in many ways. SINOVATE strives to reduce the amount of paper produced by promoting its innovative way of data transfer and storage (I.D.S). It is anticipated that the feature will have a significant positive impact on reducing paper consumption and helping to protect the environment. SINOVATE will be one of the frontrunners to make the world a greener and better place by reducing the carbon footprint.

  

## 11.8 Asset Creation Use Cases & Assets / Security Tokens

This sector will describe more potential real-world use cases of the SINOVATE network, especially concerning the Asset Creation feature tool.

Security tokens are described as tokens tied to a valuable asset. They are sometimes referred to only as STOs or âSecurity Token Offeringsâ if used for fundraising. Unlike many other types of cryptocurrencies, the regulations for security tokens have been clearly defined and can follow existing practices. Security tokens have a wide range of use cases, including the following:

  

-   Company Shares
    
-   Financial Derivatives
    
-   Local Currencies
    

-   Property
    
-   Commodities
    
-   Virtual Gaming Assets
    
-   Loyalty Rewards
    
-   Stablecoins

SINOVATE aims to act upon this opportunity while the market is still in its infancy by catering to beginners and advanced users' products and services. It is essential to attract corporate and institutional investors who share core SINOVATE values, including security, integrity, and regulatory compliance.

# 13- Marketing Strategy

From the beginning, the SINOVATE project has prided itself on clearly defining its mission, vision and values. An official website is currently live for all interested parties to easily investigate what SINOVATE is striving to achieve, and build up a competitive advantage, within the blockchain technology space. It is a clean, comprehensive, well organised and professional website where visitors can browse through an array of material. According to research, 70-80% of the marketing campaign is delivered through information distribution channels, and the official SINOVATE website embodies 80-90% of this information load. For instance, it presents the ideology behind SINOVATE, the SINOVATE team, set roadmap goals and links to other relevant communication channels. Above all else, the SINOVATE team values transparency and honesty, so it is essential that critics, end users, contributors and investors have seamless access to authentic and useful information about the project.

## 13.1 Marketing Components

Over time, a growing number of individuals and businesses have discovered the importance of social media as a powerful marketing tool to connect with potential customers and investors. SINOVATE is aware of the countless opportunities and has positioned itself to gain the highest possible exposure on social media to market the project. It provides easy access to billions of people who are free to participate when and how they choose, wherever they are in the world.

Without becoming complacent, the marketing team must refrain from overhyping the project. It is essential to report progress by maintaining a delicate balance between fostering a growing community and driving interest. SINOVATE focuses on social media streams to seamlessly report progress updates and engage with end-users. In particular, users of the SINOVATE project are warmly welcome to ask for technical support via the official Discord Server.

SINOVATEâs social media strategy will differ quite dramatically from how mainstream businesses operate online. Many companies in the mainstream share or portray content that is too generalized rather than company-specific. The philosophy at SINOVATE is to provide straightforward and honest core information, without any hassle or jargon, to the community. It is imperative to build durable and long-lasting bridges with entities that will consistently use the services and products available.

# 14- Transparency

Since the beginning of the SINOVATE project, transparency always has been a priority. It is vital for SINOVATE to regularly inform the community about development progress, financial activity, plans, and real-time support. This pure transparency had led to colossal support from the community, who continue to add value to the SINOVATE network.

  

What follows are some of how SINOVATE adheres to transparency:

-   Governance Model - Anyone can view the outcome of voting events that shape the future of the network. A democratic voting system is used to encourage users to say what is next or how things are progressing.
    
-   Monthly Financial Statements are made available to anyone who wants to know how funds are spent from the Marketing & Development Fund.
    
-   Weekly Reports and Monthly Reports - Every week and month, the SINOVATE team issues report announcements on every channel. Code development updates, community growth metrics, and progress are some topics covered to keep the community informed.
    
-   Announcements - All major and minor news regarding progress and future strategy are regularly posted on social media channels.
    
-   Code development - all past and ongoing SINOVATE code development is open source and freely accessible from the official Github repository account. Anyone can view, investigate, and suggest improvements to the underlying code of the SINOVATE network.
    
-   Roadmap - similar to how other blockchain projects function, there is a roadmap consisting of set goals to be achieved, either in the short or long term. It helps to keep the community intrigued about what is expected to be released soon.
    

  
  
  
  
  

# 15- Financial Clarification

SINOVATE provisions a 10% development fee from every block.

In the interest of optimal transparency, financial clarification is an essential aspect of the SINOVATE project. [Monthly Financial Statements](https://medium.com/@sinovatechain/sinovate-financial-statement-february-2020-dce5a247f675)

The costs of building and sustaining the project have been calculated by the team.
