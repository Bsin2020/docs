## MAC QT Wallet Backup and Upgrade Guide

  

* First of all, don't forget to back up your current data.

* Close your wallet.

* In order to see hidden folders, such as `~/Library` from Finder, simply hit `shift + âŒ˜ (command) + G` which will GO to a folder, then paste in this location:


* ```~/Library/Application Support/SIN```

Your wallet.dat file can be either in the wallets directory or in the SIN home directory, depending on the situation. Pay attention to this and back up these files to a suitable medium. We recommend that you do this periodically.
