 
# **STAKING**

SIN coins participate in the network by validating transaction blocks, increasing the network’s scalability, and making profits with the distribution of rewards. SINOVATE uses this approach alongside the PoW mechanism, which guarantees decentralization, scalability (+2,000 TPS), and security (InfinityNode LockReward and Proof-of-Burn).

  
# The features of SINOVATE Proof-of-Stake

PoS of SINOVATE (PoS4) integrates a novel feature called LockStake, where a transaction must not be spent for a considerable time to be eligible for staking. This safety guard ensures a lower attack surface of an already complex vector. Hence, the staker must wait for around 14,440 blocks (10 days approximately one block per minute) to become a staking validator. The daily block confirmations are about 1,440 blocks every 60 seconds.

The long waiting time and the long confirmation period allow the attacker to reduce the attacker’s success rate. Last but not least, the PoS mechanism will discourage centralized exchanges from using the coins they have in hand for staking.

  

In a more straightforward explanation, The SIN coins can only be used for staking if they remain in the user wallet for at least ten days. Once a staking reward is received, it is locked for one day (after that, it can only be spent); the received reward is automatically staked only after ten days of remaining in your wallet.

**Note:** The address that has the coins should not be moved between inside wallet addresses. To be eligible for staking, the inputs (received coins) must have confirmations of at least 14400 blocks (10 days).
