**How to enable coin control feature and why?**
Go to **Options menu**, (gear icon or Settings > **Options** from drop down menu), and select **Enable coin control** features, now click **OK**

From **Send** now you can see a new button named **INPUT(Coin control)**

This button allows you to open the **Coin Selection window**. You can see all transactions and select some to use.Â 

**Why is there coin control?** To keep Blockchain secured, it must have limits. Sometimes, with many transactions, you can face this limit with the error [Transaction too large](Transaction too high). Coin control helps in this and other issues.
