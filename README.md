   **Please read the following for your own protection!**

-   The SIN docs website provides documentation on different aspects of SINOVATE use. Following these guides does not make the SINOVATE liable for any encountered issues.
-   Every document furnishes protection information depending on the platform and app used; it doesn't mean you'll be 100% safe after following the documentation. Please research for potential conditions that may happen.
-   **DO NOT** use a daily computer for Staking or InfinityNodes!
-   You're responsible for your protection. The possibilities of being hacked are high even after following these manuals to access funds using a daily computer if malware gets affected.
-   **ALWAYS** do make backups of your private keys and wallet.dat files. Any wallet.dat or private keys must be backed up securely on an external USB flash storage of any kind.
-   **NEVER** share your private keys with anyone. SINOVATE team never asks for your private keys. If you share your private keys with others, you give them control of your SIN.
-   Transactions cannot be stopped, reversed, or canceled. Always check as many times as possible that the address you are sending is the correct address.
-   SINOVATE is an open-source software, and it is free to use, copy and share, but this also provides as-is with no warranty.
-   **Remember**, these protection recommendations are our thoughts; they're not supposed to comprise a definite direction on safety.
-   Likewise, the user is entirely accountable for safety; please always consider every stage observed and stay safe.


**SINOVATE (SIN)** is an open-source state-of-the-art digital cryptocurrency. 
We build innovative blockchain cloud services for individuals, developers, and enterprises. 
Decentralized cloud (dCloud), **SINCORD** messenger, proof-of-integrity, proof-of-inheritance, and blockchain-based file transfer protocol **bFTP** are some solutions for the crypto space.

# Features and Innovations

 - **X25X** GPU Algorithm. Leading-edge, in-house built, custom GPU mining algorithm. More complex, less power-hungry.
 - **Deterministic InfinityNodes** InfinityNodes are custom "burn to run" service nodes for unparalleled network security, speed, scalability and stability.
 - **NEPHELE: Incorruptible Data Storage** Blockchain-mail, Proof-of-Integrity. SINCORD messenger, proof-of-inheritance, blockchain-based file transfer protocol are stored on InfinityNodes for unlimited public or private networking of distributed data storage.

SINOVATE (SIN) combines its brand new **X25X Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm with LWMA difficulty retargeting algorithm, Reorg fork reject solution merged with proof-of-burn, PoS4 and LockReward for an unbreakable 51% attack protection.
