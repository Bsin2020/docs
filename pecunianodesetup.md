Part 1

Put some money onto the Pecunia platform. Pecunia only accepts crypto, I chose TRON because it’s got cheap transfer fees and I had some spare. When you are transferring from an exchange, make SURE you are transferring on the tron network or your crypto will be lost. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iktpU-rgyqqNkVeWO1E0MUQ-uvW6lOQkiVxXQD7ZT3xk4u9_oW9BJ844PYoOKkIJUgCNFWF5x9fl9B6pbAdHcP759I1zZscsYD4S5l4TUCtEHQuy0fxYhBpS4q71PkPRiaEqG9li4u9PynRgsk8)

Pecunia is a lot cheaper than 1-click hosting for both small and mid sizes. $6 for 6 months, whereas for big sized nodes it is $9 for six months. It’s still a lot cheaper for the big sized nodes, but it’s debateable whether or not you want to save time.
