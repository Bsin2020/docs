Part 1

Put some money onto the Pecunia platform. Pecunia only accepts crypto; I chose TRON because it’s got cheap transfer fees, and I had some spare. When you are transferring from an exchange, make SURE you are transferring on the Tron network or lose your crypto.

Pecunia is cheaper than 1-click setUP hosting for small and mid-size tiers, but it also requires some effort. $6 for six months, whereas $9 for six months for big-sized nodes. It’s still cheaper for the big-sized nodes, but it’s debatable whether or not you want to save time and effort.

Part 3

Setting up the node:
1. Return to your control wallet and create a new receiving address. In our example,  we will create MINI DIN (InfinityNodes).

2. Copy the new address you create and send it exactly 1 000 000 SIN to this address. For BIG DIN 1 000 000, for MID DIN 500 000 ,for MINI DIN 100 000.
